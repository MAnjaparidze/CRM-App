Welcome to the CRM Application Repository

In order to use everything properly, you must have any kind of command prompt/line, Git Bash is desirable, also you must have Node.js to run 'npm' commands, emulator/simulator or mobile phone with Android or IOS system. In order to start, download or clone repository into your computer.

To clone into your computer, navigate into desirable location with command prompt and 
run command: 'git clone https://github.com/MAnjaparidze/CRM-App.git' without quotation marks.

After that, navigate into CRM directory with command prompt and run command: npm install, in order to get all the dependencies, necessary for running an application.

Finally run command: react-native run-android - for Android Based Phones or 
                     react-native run-ios - for IOS Based Phones.

# Using an Application

On the login page, you have to type email and password, if email and password are not registered on firebase server, then application will prompt you to create one, just click 'OK' when asked. Application is designed to show List of People who are created by an user, List of Projects which are done by multiple people, Adding People section, List of Companies and Log Out. Other than that, everything is self-explanatory. Good Luck!
